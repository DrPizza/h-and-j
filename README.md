This project is an attempt to build attractive hyphenation and justification in JavaScript. The justification algorithm is the Knuth and Plass algorithm as implemented by [Bram Stein's Typeset effort](http://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/). Hyphenation is provided by [Hyphenator.js](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/).
